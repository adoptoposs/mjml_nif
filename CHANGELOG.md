# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

For clarity, major releases of mjml_nif use the respective [mrml] releases with the same major release number.
I.e. `mjml_nif 0.x` versions use mrml versions `>= 0.1, < 1.0.0`, and `mjml_nif 1.x` versions use mrml versions `>= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0`, etc.
