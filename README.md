Native Implemented Function (NIF) bindings for the [MJML](https://mjml.io) Rust implementation ([mrml](https://github.com/jdrouet/mrml)).

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `mjml` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mjml, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Transpile MJML templates to HTML with: 

```elixir
mjml = "<mjml>...</mjml>"
{:ok, html} = Mjml.to_html(mjml)

# For an invalid MJML template:
mjml = "something not MJML"
{:error, message} = Mjml.to_html(mjml)
```
